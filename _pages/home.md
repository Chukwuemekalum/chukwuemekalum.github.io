Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Developer in New GRA, Enugu based in Nigeria! I am often seen in some online platforms as Daniel Chiemelu or Chukwuemekalum, all still remains my alias. Though for sake of proper introduction, my name is Chukwuemekalum Daniel Chiemelu. I am operating as a freelancer, with few entitlements in different cooperatives and businesses. I currently provide contract, freelance and project-based web services. I love to observe, research, think, and solve problems and output great work. I also love music and **anime** too.

> There is no actual aim or what I would want to achieve with this website. But I would just summarize everything I like and offer and dump it here. Probably like a journal? I do not know, but I suppose it would have mixture of various things:- software development, anime, music, and some part of me too. I don't really like writing about myself to the public, but I doubt my website would get noticed by people I know **;)**.

I was in Arts in my Secondary School (Highschool) at [Federal Government College Enugu (FGCE)](http://www.fgcenugu.sch.ng/) (2013-2019), from there I did 100 level in Combined Arts (History and International Studies Department and Archeology Department) at [University of Nigeria](https://www.unn.edu.ng/), Nsukka Campus (2019-2020) and currently in 100 level in Law Department at the same University but Enugu Campus (2020-date)

I don't have any degree in Engineering as all my studies so far has been in the Arts side not sciences. Maybe in the future when I consider taking a course in a popular online or physical institution, I would have more details to put. But for now I am self taught, and it would be difficult for me to write my tech stack here and what I've done so far. Please refer to my [CV]({{site.author.cv}}{:target="_blank"})

I am an assistant professor of economics at the University of Oregon. My research fields are environmental and resource economics, which means that I study the interactions between human and natural systems. Broadly speaking, I am interested in questions like: 

- How do changes in environmental conditions affect the economy, and vice versa? 
- How should societies manage their natural resources when they are faced with uncertainty? 
- Do environmental policies function as intended, or are there unexpected consequences?
