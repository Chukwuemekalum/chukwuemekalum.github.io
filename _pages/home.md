Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Developer in New GRA, Enugu based in Nigeria! I am often seen in some online platforms as Daniel Chiemelu or Chukwuemekalum, all still remains my alias. Though for sake of proper introduction, my name is Chukwuemekalum Daniel Chiemelu. I am operating as a freelancer, with few entitlements in different cooperatives and businesses. I currently provide contract, freelance and project-based web services. I love to observe, research, think, and solve problems and output great work. I also love music and **anime** too.

> There is no actual aim or what I would want to achieve with this website. But I would just summarize everything I like and offer and dump it here. Probably like a journal? I do not know, but I suppose it would have mixture of various things:- software development, anime, music, and some part of me too. I don't really like writing about myself to the public, but I doubt my website would get noticed by people I know **;)**.
