Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Developer in New GRA, Enugu based in Nigeria! I am often seen in some online platforms as Daniel Chiemelu or Chukwuemekalum, all still remains my alias. Though for sake of proper introduction, my name is Chukwuemekalum Daniel Chiemelu. I am operating as a freelancer, with few entitlements in different cooperatives and businesses. I currently provide contract, freelance and project-based web services. I love to observe, research, think, and solve problems and output great work. I also love music and **anime** too.

> There is no actual aim or what I would want to achieve with this website. But I would just summarize everything I like and offer and dump it here. Probably like a journal? I do not know, but I suppose it would have mixture of various things:- software development, anime, music, and some part of me too. I don't really like writing about myself to the public, but I doubt my website would get noticed by people I know **;)**.

## My Education

I was in Arts in my Secondary School (Highschool) at [Federal Government College Enugu (FGCE)](http://www.fgcenugu.sch.ng/) (2013-2019), from there I did 100 level in Combined Arts (History and International Studies Department and Archeology Department) at [University of Nigeria](https://www.unn.edu.ng/), Nsukka Campus (2019-2020) and currently in 100 level in Law Department at the same University but Enugu Campus (2020-date)

## My Coding

I don't have any degree in Engineering as all my studies so far has been in the Arts side not sciences. Maybe in the future when I consider taking a course in a popular online or physical institution, I would have more details to put. But for now I am self taught, and it would be difficult for me to write my tech stack here and what I've done so far. Please refer to my [CV]({{site.author.cv}}){:target="_blank"}. But in summary I'm a PHP fan boy.

Some details that would not be added in the CV for now. After 4 years of working with Core PHP, stumbled onto Laravel Framework (21/03/2022) and completed a course. I am currently not using it, but it was a fun experience during the course, look forward to praciticing it more. I always wanted to learn C++, so I bought a course (12/07/2022), I haven't started it as of (18/07/2022), but I look forward to what C++ has to offer for me.

## My Musicals

I love playing musical instruments. Like:
<br>**i.** Piano  **ii.** Organ  **iii.** Keyboard
<br>I play those on various instances, like in church hymnals, praises in church, anime themes.

**iv.** Violin (Still learning phase) <br>
**v.** Drums (I just make some noise ðŸ˜‚) <br>
I hope to learn some more in the future. But for now, my driving passion to restart my violin journey was the need to play my anime tunes for my future partner :) and I really wanted to go back to violin again.

## My Anime

The intro could have not been complete if I didn't write about anime ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜‚ <br>
If not for anything, my banner image is Sword Art Online's landscape image.
My top three animes are:<br>

- Dragon Ball
- Sword Art Online
- One Piece
I have been working on different personal coding projects that would make my anime passion more exciting.
