## Motivation

This blog post pulls together my experiences and progress while playing Handels Messiah.
I am not a keyboard or an organ pro, just here and there knowledge put together. My interpretation
may vary from what you know.

[Messiah (Handel)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiah_(Handel)) is a popular piece used to *herald* a notable event.
I hear it most often during the Christmas period, or at times during Choir performances.
I play the organ in my choir, so I knew it was definitely something I must learn sooner or later.
My view of Handels Messiah when growing was a very ambugious piece like that meant for the pros.
I am not a pro now, but well... I'll still try my best. Its just less than 5 months before Christmas,
lets see if I can learn it before then.
