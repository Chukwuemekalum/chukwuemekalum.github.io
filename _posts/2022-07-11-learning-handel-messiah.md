## Motivation

This blog post pulls together my experiences and progress while playing Handels Messiah.
I am not a keyboard or an organ pro, my interpretation may vary from what you know.

[Messiah (Handel)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiah_(Handel)) is a popular piece used to *herald* a notable event.
I hear it most often during the Christmas period, or at times during Choir performances.
I play the organ in my choir, so I knew it was definitely something I must learn sooner or later.
My view of Handels Messiah when growing was a very ambugious piece like that meant for the pros.
I am not a pro now, but well... I'll still try my best. Its just less than 5 months before Christmas,
lets see if I can learn it before then.

## Introduction

In as much as I know this piece is what I would love to learn, I am not that pressurized to learn in a haste.
I am just taking my time to practice when I can. At times once a week, or twice, or more.  
And maximum I've practiced a day is an hour, I am also learning the Violin; maintaining balance is good too.

This classical piece I am working with has **94 measures, 5 pages in total**. And apparently, it took me two weeks
to learn page 1. If one is to do mental maths, we should hope in 10 weeks I should be done, considering my learning
curve :)
